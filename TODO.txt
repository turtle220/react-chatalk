    DONE --> Will you also have the ability to start on the Group List and User List API on this screen:
    DONE --> If we are on the user tab (screenshot), then display list of groups on left, and list of users on right table. For now don't worry about the mapping/filtering, just list all.
    DONE --> If we click on sub groups tab, display the same form as in the Create new Group form, but allow it to edit and save new values for Description and Tags
            Let me know the relation with group and tag.
    OK --> Roles tab can be left blank for now
    ?? --> And then the 2 buttons: Create New Group and Create New User: those forms should like to back-end too.
    But I need the table, tiles/tabs, filters, and tree list to all use fuse theme components, these still look like the old template
